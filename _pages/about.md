[//]:<>Life emerges from the collective behavior of myriads of molecules.
[//]:<>Over the past 100 years biology has been extremely successful at identifying and characterizing important biomolecules.
[//]:<>Yet, we still lack the collective understanding that would allow us to 
I am a computational biophysicist interested in how collective molecular behavior yields complex biological phenomena.
I attained a Physics Ph.D. at University of Chicago in 2018 (advisor: [Aaron Dinner](https://dinner-group.uchicago.edu/)) studying cytokseletal networks and am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University working with [Madhav Mani](https://madhavmani.com) to understand the dynamics of embryonic and tissue development. 
I aim to lead a research group that uses physics, math, and computation to solve problems that are fundamental to basic biology and critical for public health.

[//]:<> Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[//]:<> Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[//]:<> Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
